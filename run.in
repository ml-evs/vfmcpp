# INITIAL CONDITIONS:
#
#	path 
#		data folder path relative to vfmcpp root folder (will be created if doesn't exist or emptied if exists)
#	
#	time	
#		total length of time to simulate
#	
#	resl	
#		specify the resolution of the simulation in metres, filaments will be created, default=6.28e-8 (1um radius ring w/ 100 pts) #
#
#	ring [radius, x, y, z, alignment]
#		make a closed filament, requires 5 arguments as above, where the 5th is one of [0,1,2] for axis to align to.#
#
#	line [length, x, y, z, alignment]
#		make an open filament, requires 5 arguments as above.
#	
#	delayed_ring [radius, x, y, z, alignment, t]
#		additional argument for time t in ms to delay the addition of the ring.#
#
#	lfil [path]
#		reads positions and velocities of a premade (normally distorted) line from path/pos.dat and path/vel.dat respectively.#
#
#	Eext [strength, duration, direction]
#		include an external electric field, requires 3 arguments where direction is either 0, 1 or 2 for x, y or z.#
#
#	q_pt [filament, point, magnitude]
#		add a charge to a filament, requires filaments to be specified eariler in file, 
#		filament is the relative position of the filament in the .in file, (first filament = 0), 
#		point is the index of the desired charged point on the filament, and magnitude is the size of the charge.#
#
#	#
#		indicates a comment, which will be ignored by vfmcpp#
